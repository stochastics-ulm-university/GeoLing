GeoLing - a statistical software package for geolinguistic data
===============================================================


What is GeoLing and what does it do?
------------------------------------

In short, GeoLing is a handy tool for performing statistical analyses on
spatial data: You can use data from dialect surveys, transform them into
smoothed maps (via density estimation), detect structures that run
through the data and find groups of maps that share spatial features.

We developed this program with linguistic applications in mind, but that
should not stop you from using it for any kind of spatially conditioned
data.


Acknowledgements
----------------

GeoLing was written as a part of the project *New Dialectometry Using
Methods of Stochastic Image Analysis*, financed by the Deutsche
Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) between 2008 and 2014. All the work has
been carried out by people associated with three institutions:

* Institute of Stochastics (Ulm University)
* Lehrstuhl f√ºr Deutsche Sprachwissenschaft (University of Augsburg)
* Fachbereich Germanistik (University of Salzburg)

Hardware and system requirements
--------------------------------

An up-to-date Java runtime environment is recommended, at least Java 7
is required. You can obtain the latest version of Java at
<https://www.java.com/download>.
Note that at least 2 GB RAM have to be installed for execution of
GeoLing. Depending on the data and analyses, more memory may be required -
which then also implies the need for a 64-bit operating system and
64-bit Java runtime.
